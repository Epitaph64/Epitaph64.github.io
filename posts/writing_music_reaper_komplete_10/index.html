<p>I recently purchased a copy of Komplete 10 as the DAW I use (Reaper) doesn’t include that many VSTis, and it comes with no sampled instruments at all. My first foray into commercial music production software was the purchase of ValhallaDSP’s <a href="https://valhalladsp.com/shop/reverb/valhalla-room/">ValhallaRoom</a> which greatly improved the overall sound I was able to get out of the free VSTs I had found and used up to that point. However, once I bought <a href="https://www.pianoteq.com/">PianoTeq 5</a> I realized just how much better commercially produced VSTis could sound.</p>

<p>Eventually I decided upon buying Komplete 10, as it seemed to come with a great variety of VSTis and VST effects. I’ve since spent a good deal of time with it, and I’ve probably only explored about 20-30% of what it has to offer. Below I’ve included two of my most recently made songs using this software.</p>

<p>Note: These songs require HTML5 to play. However, you can find them on my <a href="http://epitaph64.newgrounds.com/audio/">Newgrounds Page</a> which uses a flash based audio player.</p>
