<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>I've been thinking about creating some basic software for my purposes of tracking
the evolution of my indoor gardening experiments. To preface why I would want to
do such a thing I should say that I began by buying a few small
dracaena deremensis (a cultivar of the species <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracaena_fragrans">dracaena fragrans</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sansevieria">sansevieria</a> plants one day after being given a gift card
to a home improvement store.</p>

<p>I decided to approach the process of growing the plants as scientifically as
possible (given my training as a computer science major.) Because of this, and the
general hardiness of those two plant species I had decent success (apart from some
kitty training that had to take place as my cat had never seen living plants as
an adult.) Those plants grew much taller as a result of the leaf
damage that they sustained. Luckily my cat was also fine as a result of gnawing on the leaves as she didn't eat them only wanted
to taste or damage them perhaps.</p>

<p>I have since purchased and grown a few types of plants from seeds in the ~3 months or so since then. For my bedroom I purchased two
medium sized plants; a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrolepis_exaltata">boston fern</a> (nephrolepis exaltata) and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracaena_reflexa#Dracaena_Marginata">dracaena marginata</a> (also known as dracaena reflexa.) I'm also attempting to grow blue lake pole beans, peppermint, lemon balm, and a bird's nest fern (you can tell my addiction was sudden and
severe.) Overall, I have found this new hobby to be extremely
enriching and enjoyable. I already am thinking of plans for what
I plan to grow this winter and next spring.</p>
