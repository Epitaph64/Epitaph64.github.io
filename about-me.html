    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I am a software developer and musician who is most at peace when he is creating something.
     I am also currently a Senior Undergraduate of Computer Science at the University of Arizona. Below is a short list of some of the projects
     I've worked on over the past few years, as well as links to other platforms which I have content on.</p>

            <td><p>Hired to overhaul the ECCL website, I've worked on numerous feature and security improvements to the
             site over the past year. A few notable ones are a permissions and user management system, a BibTex parser
             using regular expressions which is capable of correcting small syntactical errors, and PDO prepared statements
             when appropriate to better protect against SQL injection.</p></td>
